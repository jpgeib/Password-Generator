# Password-Generator

This assignment involved making a random password generator that creates passwords between 8-128 characters, and takes numbers, upper and lowercase letters, and special characters. I made these parameters toggles, in case a user wants to only use a certain combination of characters. Also, there is a clipboard function to copy and paste the result.
